# Finger Counting using Convex Hull Algorithm

The aim of this project is to enable an autonomous system to count the number of fingers being shown by a human user. The system uses the embedded camera to look at the camera and perform certain operations on the input to finally extrapolate the number of fingers being shown and display the number on screen. One of the most special feature of this project is that it solves the tedious task of using a deep learning model which includes training and testing on large datasets and unnecessary time and space consumption. Instead it uses hand segmentation, contour approximation and a simple Convex Hull Algorithm to perform geometrical analysis and determine the number of fingers being displayed.
